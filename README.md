json4c
======

Yes, there are buckets of JSON parser. But I found that some of them is so complicated and obscure, though they MAY be perform well. If you wreite a project like Nginx, do you intend to use a JSON parser which has a heap of code?

json4c is a pretty lightweighted and graceful json parser.
